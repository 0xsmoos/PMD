Server Media Downloader (soon to be merged into *Plex Bot*)

## Goal:
 * Create an accessible means for anyone who wants to to contribute media to a Plex server
 * Add as much automation to the proccess as possible
 * Set and forget functionality
 	* No need to sit around waiting for loading screens, just queue up what you want and let the server take care of it
 	* All the downloads are done server side, so there are no large data transfers from client to server

## Plans:
 * DISCORD BOT:
 	* The Discord bot is for quick and easy uploading, for uploading a single item, this is what you need
 	* More simplistic and familiar system and cleaner interface
 * WINDOWS/MAC BINARY:
 	* For deeper integration and further automation, this is the way to go
 	* With more automation, things like automatically reading data directly from the browser become possible, you won't even need to open the Chrome Developer Menu (Inspect Element)
 		* [ ] Coming soon, either an advanced web scraper, or a websocket proxy
